When you created your isssue wait until maintainers valid your issue. Once it's validate you can start to discuss with others contributors about the best solution.

## Testing

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to Tech for a better world](https://github.com/Tech-for-better-world/Tech-for-better-world/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). When you send a pull request, we will love you forever if you include RSpec examples. We can always use more test coverage. Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:
